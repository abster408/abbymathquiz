Work experince:
During my time at my work expeirence I have learned basics of javascript in which to code a website/app. I have also learned how to correct my mistakes
during the coding period(of which there were many). I have enjoyed my time here learing new things and seeing what looks like just some random words on a 
line turn into something that actually works and has a purpose. I would probably do something like again if I got the opportunity because I enjoy working
towards an end product.

...

Imrovements:
Although I am proud of what I have made, there are many possible improvements to make. For intance, the background of the image does not match the 
background of the page, the buttons(such as 'start' and 'mark') don't exaclty look amazing-this is probably because I didn't change how they look 
at all becuase I don't know if its possible and even if it is I wouldn't know where to start, the overall look of the website doesn't look
that great and very amature(of which it is but no-one knows that). The 'scoreboard' doesn't save the names after a refresh and also it works in order of
when the quiz was completed rather than in ranking order(in order of who got the most points). 

If I was to do this again/do a similar project I would spend more time on making everything run smoother.

To use what I have created at home I would just need to use the link: https://math-quiz-f1038.firebaseapp.com

If I would like to make changes to my project at home I would need to install the following programs:
-Atom IDE
-Git bash
-Node.Js
	-Angular
	-Firebase
	-Bootstrap

--these allow editing

...

//run app /start app
-ng serve
-(intenet) localhost:4200

...

//build app-distrubutes(dist folder)
-ng build

...

//making changes to github

-git status
-get add .
-git commit -m "init project"
-git push

...

To add the new changes to the 'firebase' deployed version:

-making changes to a hosted firebase app
-use 'ng build'
-then use 'firebase deploy'


-clone the code from github using git bash
-git clone <git hub repo URL >
-
-use 'ng build'
-then use 'firebase deploy'

...

To use a previous version of the project on firebase:
-Go on to the 'hosting' tab
-There is a 'deployment history'
-find which previous version you would like to go back to 
-hover mouse on the left side of your selection-3 vertiacal dots should appear
-click them and then select 'Rollback'
-This will bring your selection to the top and change the status to 'Rolled back'.
